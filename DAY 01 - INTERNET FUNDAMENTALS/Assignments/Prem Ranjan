First day of the web development bootcamp i have learned about the basics and fundamentals of the internet.

The topics which I have learned over this session are the following.

Domain
Domain means that specific to the internet, the term domain can refer to how the internet is structured, 
and domain also refers to how an organization's network resources are organized. 

DNS 
The domain name system (DNS) is a naming database in which internet domain 
names are located and translated into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

HTTP/HTTPS
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is certain set of rules which the 
client and the server both have to follow to set up a succesful communication. 
HTTPS stand for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secured. It is used to used to transfer encrypted data. 
We can not send encrypted data in HTTP as it lacks security.

Ports and Port Numbers
A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or
other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. 

Request Methods
The most commonly used HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. 
These are equivalent to the CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete). GET: GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server.
